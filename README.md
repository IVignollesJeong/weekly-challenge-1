# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This project was a refactor of the webpage for Horiseon Social Solutions Services to meet accessibility standards. The code refactor was done with the consideration of the following guidelines: 

- Add semantic elements to the HTML structure.
- Organize the HTML and CSS code to follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Add accessible alt attributes to the image elements.
- Modify the website title to be concise and descriptive.
- Fix broken links and consolidate codebase.
- Add comments within code to improve developer accessibility.

Structure and appearance of the original webpage was not altered, only the code.
